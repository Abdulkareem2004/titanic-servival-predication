Steps for the Project:
1.Load the Dataset
Download the Titanic dataset from Kaggle Titanic Competition. It contains:
train.csv for training the model.
test.csv for evaluation.

2.Explore and Clean the Data
Handle missing values.
Convert categorical data into numerical format (e.g., using one-hot encoding).
Feature selection based on correlation with the target (Survived).

3.Feature Engineering
Create new features, such as FamilySize (combining SibSp and Parch) or processing the Name column to extract titles.

4.Split the Data
Divide the dataset into features (X) and target (y), and split it further into training and validation sets.

5.Train the Model
Use machine learning models such as:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)

6.Evaluate the Model
Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score on the validation set.

7.Make Predictions on Test Data
Apply the trained model to the test data and prepare it for submission.
